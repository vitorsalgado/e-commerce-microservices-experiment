Architecture and Patterns study project.  
The goal here is to study architecture, patterns, algorithms, new technologies and techniques.  

## The Project
We you start focusing on **Microservices**. For this, we are going to build a simple e-commerce where we are going to 
apply several patterns, techniques, languages in something closer to real life.  
The idea is to build several self-contained projects, scripts, support applications, documentations and all of then should 
be stored on this repository.
